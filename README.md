Dotfiles
========
"Forked" from https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles

His script was written in bash, I chose to re-write it in Python.

For security reasons, my actual dotfile repo is private.  Sorry ;-)

Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/noisufnoc/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
# cp your dotfiles from your homedir
chmod +x dotfiles.py
./dotfiles.py
```
